# Neural Learning Agent Documentation

## 1. Neural Network Architecture

The neural network architecture for our learning agent is designed to process visual input and make decisions based on the observed state. Here's a breakdown of the architecture:

- Input shape: (64, 64, 3) - Representing a 64x64 RGB image
- Convolutional layers:
  - Conv2D layer 1: 32 filters, 3x3 kernel, ReLU activation
  - Conv2D layer 2: 64 filters, 3x3 kernel, ReLU activation
- MaxPooling layers: 2x2 pool size, following each Conv2D layer
- Flatten layer: To convert 2D feature maps to 1D feature vector
- Dense layers:
  - Hidden layer: 64 units, ReLU activation
  - Output layer: Linear activation (number of units depends on action space)

## 2. Training Process

Our training process incorporates multiple advanced techniques:

### Reinforcement Learning
- Algorithm: Q-learning
- Policy: Epsilon-greedy (ε = 0.1)
- Discount factor (γ): 0.99

### Meta-learning
- Adaptation to different tasks through rapid learning
- Implemented in the `meta_learning_update()` function

### Self-play
- Generation of training data through agent vs. agent gameplay
- Implemented in the `self_play()` function

## 3. Custom Environment (CustomEnv-v0)

A custom OpenAI Gym environment has been created for training:

- Observation space: Box(low=0, high=255, shape=(64, 64, 3), dtype=np.uint8)
- Action space: Discrete(2)
- Step method: Generates random state, reward, and done flag
- Reset method: Initializes state randomly
- Render method: Prints current state

## 4. Key Functions

- `create_model()`: Constructs the neural network model
- `train_model()`: Implements the reinforcement learning training loop
- `meta_learning_update()`: Handles meta-learning updates
- `self_play()`: Manages self-play for data generation

## 5. Training Parameters

- Number of episodes: 1000
- Epsilon (for epsilon-greedy policy): 0.1
- Gamma (discount factor): 0.99
