# Neural Learning Agent Documentation

## 1. Project Overview

This project aims to create a neural network agent incorporating deep learning, reinforcement learning, meta-learning, and self-play, inspired by Ilya Sutskever's ideas. The agent is designed to learn and adapt in a custom environment, showcasing advanced AI techniques in a practical setting.

## 2. Environment Setup

- Framework: TensorFlow
- Custom Gym environment: CustomEnv-v0
- Environment location: /home/ubuntu/nueral-learning-agent/environments/custom_env.py

## 3. Neural Network Architecture

The neural network model uses a convolutional architecture with batch normalization and dropout:

- Input shape: (64, 64, 3) - Representing a 64x64 RGB image
- Convolutional layers with batch normalization and dropout
- Dense layers with increased complexity
- Output shape: 2 (number of actions in the custom environment)

Detailed architecture:
[Include specific details of conv layers, dense layers, etc.]

## 4. Training Process

Our training process incorporates multiple advanced techniques:

- Algorithm: Double DQN
- Exploration: Decaying epsilon-greedy strategy
- Optimizer: Adam with learning rate schedule
- Number of training episodes: 100
- Discount factor (Î³): 0.99

[Include more details on meta-learning, self-play, etc.]

## 5. Custom Environment (CustomEnv-v0)

- Observation space: Box(low=0, high=255, shape=(64, 64, 3), dtype=np.uint8)
- Action space: Discrete(2)
- State: 2D image with shape (64, 64, 3)
- Actions: Two possible actions [describe the actions]

## 6. Performance Metrics

- Average reward over 100 evaluation episodes: 0.832432565099119
- Detailed performance data available in `evaluation_rewards.json`
- [Include any other relevant metrics or analysis]
