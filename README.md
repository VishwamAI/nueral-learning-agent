# Neural Learning Agent

This project aims to create a neural network agent that incorporates deep learning, reinforcement learning, meta-learning, and self-play principles inspired by Ilya Sutskever's work.

## Installation

To set up the project environment:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/VishwamAI/nueral-learning-agent.git
cd nueral-learning-agent
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

To train the neural network agent:

```bash
python main.py
```

## Project Structure

- `src/`: Source code for the neural network agent.
- `tests/`: Test scripts for the neural network agent.
- `environments/`: Custom Gym environments.
- `requirements.txt`: Project dependencies.

## Contribution

Contributions are welcome. Please ensure all tests pass before submitting a pull request.

## Acknowledgments

Inspired by Ilya Sutskever's insights into AI and machine learning.

## Testing

Run the following command to execute tests:

```bash
python -m unittest
```
