# Neural Learning Agent

## Project Description
This project implements a neural network agent using TensorFlow, incorporating principles of deep learning, reinforcement learning, meta-learning, and self-play as discussed by Ilya Sutskever. The agent interacts with a custom Gym environment (CustomEnv-v0), demonstrating advanced AI techniques in a practical application.

## Installation
To set up the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository
2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

Dependencies include:
- TensorFlow
- Gym
- [List any other major dependencies]

## Usage
To train the agent:
```
python main.py
```

To demonstrate the agent's capabilities:
```
python demo.py
```

For a detailed walkthrough of the agent's functionality, refer to the `DEMONSTRATION.md` file.
