# Neural Learning Agent Demonstration

## Overview
This document outlines the plan for demonstrating the capabilities of our neural network agent within the custom environment (CustomEnv-v0).

## Demonstration Steps

1. Environment Setup
   - Load the custom environment (CustomEnv-v0)
   - Initialize the neural network agent

2. Single Episode Walkthrough
   - Run a single episode, showing:
     - Initial state
     - Agent's actions at each step
     - Resulting state and reward
     - Final outcome (success or failure)

3. Performance Metrics
   - Display key metrics:
     - Average reward per episode
     - Success rate over multiple episodes
     - Learning curve (reward vs. episode number)
     - Total reward per episode
   - Highlight the training process running for 1000 episodes
   - Analyze the 'episode_rewards.json' file:
     - Visualize the per-episode rewards over time
     - Identify trends and patterns in the agent's performance
   - Provide guidance on interpreting the metrics:
     - Higher total rewards indicate better overall performance
     - Compare rewards across episodes to assess learning progress
     - Look for consistent improvement in rewards over time

4. Meta-Learning Demonstration
   - Show the agent's ability to adapt to slight variations in the environment
   - Compare performance before and after meta-learning updates
   - Highlight the meta-learning parameters: num_tasks=10, inner_steps=20, outer_steps=10
   - Demonstrate how these parameters affect the agent's adaptability

5. Self-Play Demonstration
   - Showcase two instances of the agent playing against each other
   - Highlight improvements in strategy over multiple self-play iterations

6. Visualization
   - Create plots or animations to visualize:
     - Agent's decision-making process
     - State representations
     - Reward accumulation over time
   - Analyze the logged per-episode rewards:
     - Load and parse the 'episode_rewards.json' file
     - Create a line plot showing rewards over episodes
     - Identify trends, learning progress, and potential plateaus
   - Interpret the results:
     - Discuss the overall learning curve
     - Highlight episodes with significant improvements
     - Analyze the impact of meta-learning on reward patterns

## Implementation Details

To implement this demonstration, we will need to:

1. Create a separate Python script (e.g., `demo.py`) that loads the trained model and runs through the demonstration steps.
2. Implement logging and visualization functions to capture and display the relevant metrics and agent behaviors.
3. Ensure the custom environment (CustomEnv-v0) supports a render mode that can be used for visualization purposes.

## Next Steps

- Implement the `demo.py` script
- Create necessary visualization functions
- Test the demonstration with the trained model
- Prepare a presentation or video showcasing the agent's capabilities
